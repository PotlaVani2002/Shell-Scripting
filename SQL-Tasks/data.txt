In today's system logs, the "Error" occurred in multiple places. The most critical error was identified at 3:00 PM. It seems that an ERROR related to the database connection was not handled properly, leading to additional errors throughout the day. This error resulted in a timeout, causing further issues. However, the error was resolved after the restart. We need to monitor for any new error messages related to the system's performance in the coming days.
